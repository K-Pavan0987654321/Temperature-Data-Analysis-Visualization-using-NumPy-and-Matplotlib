# Project Workflow

# 1️⃣ Data Collection
Temperature values are stored in NumPy arrays to enable fast numerical operations.

# 2️⃣ Data Cleaning
 Invalid temperature values are replaced with `NaN`
 Missing data is removed using Boolean indexing

# 3️⃣ Data Analysis
 Mean, maximum, minimum, and standard deviation calculation
 Identification of hot days (>35°C)
 Sorting and ranking of temperatures
 Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion

# 4️⃣ Weekly Temperature Analysis
 Generated 2D NumPy array (7×3)
 Calculated time-wise average temperatures
 Identified daily maximum temperatures

# 5️⃣ Data Visualization
 Line chart for daily temperature trend
 Bar chart for daily temperature comparison
 Histogram for temperature distribution
 Multi-line chart for weekly temperature patterns

# 📊 Key NumPy Concepts Used
 Array creation and reshaping
 Boolean indexing
 NaN handling
